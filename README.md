# Mining music data from Spotify using Python'

Through our project, we aim to extract hit song data from Spotify and use country-wise data to 
analyze listening trends over the decade. This analysis should provide us with listener behavior 
in each country, along with providing distinguishing factors for each. Thus, our project seeks
to analyze past music trends by country in order to predict future trends which will aid record 
companies in terms of optimal investment of money and allocation of resources on the basis of 
genre and artist, to maximize profit and buzz.
