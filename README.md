# CSCI 6443: Data Mining
## Mining music data from Spotify using Python
### Mahpara Nuzhat and Aarvi Thadeshwar

Through our project, we aim to extract hit song data from Spotify and use country-wise data to 
analyze listening trends over the decade. This analysis should provide us with listener behavior 
in each country, along with providing distinguishing factors for each. Thus, our project seeks
to analyze past music trends by country in order to predict future trends which will aid record 
companies in terms of optimal investment of money and allocation of resources on the basis of 
genre and artist, to maximize profit and buzz.

This repository contains all the datasets used in our project, and notebooks for each data mining
step implemented by us.
